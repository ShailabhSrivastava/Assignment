Task: Develop a RESTful API with Node.js
Background:
Your task is to develop a RESTful API that will be used by a web-based application to
manage users. The API should be built using Node.js and should interact with a MongoDB
database.
Requirements:
1. The API should support the following endpoints:
● GET /users - Returns a list of all users
● GET /users/:id - Returns a single user by ID
● POST /users - Creates a new user
● PUT /users/:id - Updates a user by ID
● DELETE /users/:id - Deletes a user by ID
2. All endpoints should return JSON responses.
3. The API should have proper error handling and should return appropriate error
messages in case of errors.
4. The API should validate the input data for each endpoint and return appropriate error
messages in case of validation failures.
5. The API should use JWT authentication for user authorization.
6. The API should be documented using Swagger or a similar tool.
7. The API should be containerized using Docker.
8. The code should be hosted on GitHub and should be properly documented and
commented.
Deliverables:
A GitHub repository containing the source code for the API.
A Docker image for the API.
API documentation using Swagger or a similar tool.
